Snowball: Extracting Relations from Large Plain-Text Collections
================================================================

This is my own implementation of the the Snowball system to bootstrap relationship instances. You can find more details here:

**NOTE**: this version is not tested and might contain bugs/errors, I recommend you instead to look at the [Python implementation of Snowball](https://github.com/davidsbatista/Snowball)
